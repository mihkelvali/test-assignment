# TEST ASSIGNMENT FOR FRONT-END INTERNSHIP IN MOONCASCADE
#### SUMMER 2018

The aim of the test assignment is to create a single-page weather app.

## Requirements for the application

1. The user should be able to search for a location, that he/she wants the weather prediction for.
2. Location offers are displayed in real time as the user types into the input.
3. The user should be able to select a location from a dropdown, that suggests different locations based on the search input.
4. After the user has selected a location, a detailed view of the weather on that day is shown.

## Non-mandatory tasks

1. Make the app responsive to a width of 320px.
2. Write tests for your app.

## Design

The app should look like the designs we have provided in https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5b473a0e6396e8127ef6dfd4.

Different icons for the designs are provided in `/src/icons/`.

## API

It is mandatory to use the following API to fetch data internship-proxy.aw.ee:3001.

| Endpoint | Description |Â Example |
|-|-|-|
| `/location` | With `query` as parameter gives you a list of the locations that correspond to the query string. | internship-proxy.aw.ee:3001/location?query=new |
| `/location/{woeid}` | `woeid` is one of the properties of a location. This request provides detailed weather information about a location. | internship-proxy.aw.ee:3001/location/2459115|

Both of the requests are made by using GET method. The API is based on https://www.metaweather.com/api/. In order to implement the designs, the weather state icons can be downloaded from there.
